		HypochondriApp is a symptom tracker that lets you keep track of all kinds of symptoms (e.g. Fever, Coughing, Head ache etc.) in a simple way. One click adds a symptom event to your symptom history, or you can add more detail by adjusting severity and duration, and even adding a comment. And, you can go back and edit or delete a symptom event at any time.
